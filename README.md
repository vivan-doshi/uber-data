# Uber Pickups NYC Data Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks analyzing Uber pickup data in New York City. The analysis explores patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering, and regression techniques for explanatory and causal inference.

## Notebooks

1.  **`01_Uber_Pickups_NYC_Algorithmic_EDA_Clustering.ipynb`**
    * Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the NYC Uber pickup dataset.
    * Uses visualization techniques to understand spatial and temporal patterns.
    * Applies clustering algorithms to identify potential hotspots or groups within the pickup data.

2.  **`02_Uber_Pickups_NYC_Regressions_for_Explanatory_and_Causal_Inference.ipynb`**
    * Utilizes regression models to explain relationships within the Uber pickup data.
    * Explores techniques for causal inference to understand potential cause-and-effect relationships related to pickups.
    * Discusses the fundamental problem of causal inference and potential approaches.
